Run the app.py in Anaconda Prompt with the command python app.py.
After pausing the execution,run the command python setup.build.
This will create a folder named as 'build' that provides an application version of app.py.
Create a shortcut of this on the desktop that can be directly accessed whenever necessary instead of running the program every single time.
